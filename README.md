# Final_Project
- NLP Sentimental Analysis on Healthcare Reviews

# Problem 
- Analyze sentiments in healthcare reviews.

# Objective
- The goal of this project is to develop a model that can classify sentiments in healthcare reviews. This involves analyzing text data from healthcare reviews and determining whether the sentiment expressed in each review is positive, negative, or neutral.

# Tasks:
- Data Preprocessing: This task involves cleaning and preparing the text data from healthcare reviews. It includes tasks like text tokenization, removing stopwords, and handling any missing data.
- Sentiment Analysis Model: Develop a machine learning or natural language processing (NLP) model that can classify sentiments in healthcare reviews. This model should be able to categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on the text content.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the sentiment analysis model using appropriate evaluation metrics. This step is crucial to ensure the model's accuracy and effectiveness.
- Insights & Visualization: After building and evaluating the model, generate insights from the sentiment analysis results. Visualize the data and findings to communicate the results effectively.
